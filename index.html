<div class="textblock"><p>This is the official documentation for the Conestoga Robotics Innovation Group's InMoov project. It is not meant to be read linearly or all at once. Rather, readers should skim relevant pages and skip information that requires more context. More in depth information is provided for those that wish to modify the source code. Examples are provided when possible for quick reference and experimentation. Note that colored phrases are links for both html and pdf. This project has a git repository located <a href="https://github.com/rbong/rig-inmoov">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Dependencies"></a>
Dependencies</h1>
<p>The project currently depends on <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> for an example script, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a> (if you wish to remake the documentation) and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> (if you wish to build the project).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Quick_Start"></a>
Quick Start</h1>
<p>To quickly upload to the right hand, do the following. Copy the <b>arduino/servo</b> folder to your Arduino sketch folder. Copy <b><a class="el" href="servo_2settings_2rhand_8h.html">servo/settings/rhand.h</a></b> to <b>servo/settings.h</b> in the sketch directory. Copy <b><a class="el" href="serial_8ino_source.html">arduino/lib/serial.ino</a></b> to <b>servo/serial.ino</b> in the sketch directory. Open the Arduino software. Select your board and the port it is connected to. Open your sketch, and hit upload. Instructions for the Arduino software are located <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">on its website</a>. Other Arduino files on the bot can be built in a similar way, or the <b>make</b> system command can be used.</p>
<p>To transmit commands to the board, run this from the command line. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;python -i example/rhand.py</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> You can now run commands defined in <a class="el" href="namespacerhand.html">rhand</a>.</p>
<p>The python script needs the pyserial library. Its website is located <a href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/">here.</a></p>
<p>Call this to connect to the board (replace COM0 with the name of the port you set in Arduino). </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;connect (<span class="stringliteral">&#39;COM0&#39;</span>)</div>

</div><!-- fragment --><p> Note that some movements require input before continuing (press enter).</p>
<p>Read the <a class="el" href="namespacerhand.html">rhand</a> documentation for more. Read the <a class="el" href="index.html#Examples">Examples</a> section to understand how it formulates commands.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Installation"></a>
Installation</h1>
<p>You can build this documentation with the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;make documentation</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory.</p>
<p>To upload the right hand servo code to the connected Arduino, run </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;make servo.ino SETTINGS=rhand ARDUINO_DO=--upload BOARD=nano</div>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="Build"></a>
Build System</h1>
<h2>Arduino Directory Structure</h2>
<p>The Arduino IDE abstracts many tools for working with Arduino hardware. We choose to use it because of its familiarity and cross system compatibility. However, the Arduino IDE isn't made for command line compilation, and replicating its process requires complex tools not appropriate for this project.</p>
<p>To share code among certain boards, general code is kept in the <b>arduino/sketch</b> subdirectories. Inside each subdirectory is an <b></b>.ino file of the same name, which is the source for the sketch. There is also a <b>settings</b> folder in which various headers are kept. These headers are to be moved to <b>settings.h</b> inside the sketch folder. For example, code to be shared among servos is kept in <b><a class="el" href="servo_8ino.html">arduino/sketch/servo/servo.ino</a></b>, the configuration for the right hand is kept in <b><a class="el" href="servo_2settings_2rhand_8h.html">arduino/sketch/servo/settings/rhand.h</a></b>, and you would move it to <b>arduino/sketch/servo/settings.h</b> to use it.</p>
<p>Some sketches require shared code that use Arduino libraries, which means that they need to be contained in <b></b>.ino files. Arduino includes any <b></b>.ino files inside a sketch subdirectory. We keep such files in <b>arduino/lib</b>. For example, servo boards require serial communication, so we would move <b><a class="el" href="serial_8ino_source.html">arduino/lib/serial.ino</a></b> to the <b>arduino/sketch/servo</b> directory.</p>
<p>The reason that shared code among the same board types is treated differently than shared code among different board types is to allow us to keep the settings files short, and also to use them elsewhere in the project that is not necessarily Arduino code.</p>
<p>This is all automated by the build system. If you wish to use the Arduino IDE, either link the appropriate files to your Arduino sketch directory or copy them to the sketch directory and write the changes back later.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Arduino"></a>
Arduino Protocol</h1>
<p>The Arduinos controlling the various parts of the bot communicate over their serial ports. All information is sent and recieved using 8 bit unsigned raw integers instead of text. This allows extremely fast and simple code, but limits programs to 255 signals, identifiers, and values.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino boards only have one function; to pass commands to their servos.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Servo Position</dt><dd>Unless otherwise instructed, the Arduino accepts two values at a time. First, it accepts a servo ID, and a value to write to the pin associated with that servo. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Servo IDs start at 0 and should be uniquely identified on every board, allowing a maximum of 255 servos on each bot, not including signals. They should be assigned different values because if commands are routed through a central board, it allows the protocol to remain the same. If an invalid servo ID is passed to any given board, the board will still read another value from the serial port to avoid syncing issues, but it will do nothing to its servos. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Servo Values</dt><dd>The value passed to the servo can be from 0-180. If it exceeds 180 and is not a valid signal, the board will change the angle to 180. On positional rotation servos, this number represents the servo's target angle. On continuous rotation servos, 90 represents stillness, 180 represents full speed in one direction, and 0 represents full speed in the other. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Each board has callibrations for each servo that scale the angles from 0-180 to some minimum angle and some maximum angle. The host program has no need to know these values. When the board reports current values, they are non-scaled. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>To ensure that the board is reading the correct information (servo ID or servo position), there is a cancel signal.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Signals</dt><dd>The boards accept some pre-defined signals that break the default flow. It can recieve these signals at any time and will terminate its current servo command. In addition, the board may print some signals to output. Both kinds of signals, incoming and outgoing, are assigned starting from 255 and going down. In the arduino code, incoming signals are denoted by <b>*_SIGNAL</b>, and the outgoing signals are denoted by <b>*_RESPONSE</b>. We will use this convention.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>CANCEL_SIGNAL</dt><dd>This signal exists to cancel all pending input and syncronize the host and master. If a host connects to an Arduino and does not know its current state, it can send this signal and know that the board is waiting on a servo ID.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>WAIT_RESPONSE</dt><dd>This response indicates that the board has no bytes left to read and is ready for input. A host does not need to wait for this response, but it may want to if it is experiencing difficulties or the board may have crashed.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>START_RESPONSE, END_RESPONSE</dt><dd>These responses mark the beginning and end of a reply to some signal.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>DUMP_SIGNAL</dt><dd>This signal makes the board return various information about itself and its servos. As of writing, it returns <b>START_RESPONSE</b>, an ID, its number of servos, the IDs of each servo followed by the value last sent to that servo, and <b>END_RESPONSE</b>. If a serial connection is connected to other boards and is able to send it commands, it may send more servo IDs and servo positions before <b>END_RESPONSE</b>. Board IDs start from 181 and go up. It is recommended that if we build more modular bots such as this one in the future using the same protocol, they recieve unique board identifiers. The response is likely to change in the near future as we add sensors and other types of devices. Be sure to regularly check this document.</dd></dl>

</div><!-- fragment --><p> This would send the servo with ID 0 a value of 180, servo 1 135, and servo 2 90. The board would then respond with <b>WAIT_RESPONSE</b>. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;CANCEL_SIGNAL 0 180 1 135 22 CANCEL_SIGNAL 4 45</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This would send the servo with ID 0 a value of 180, servo 1 135, begin to read a command for servo 22 but cancel, then send 45 to servo 4. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;CANCEL_SIGNAL 0 0 1 45 2 90 3 135 4 180 DUMP_SIGNAL</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> On a board with ID <b>BOARD_ID</b> and 5 servos identified as 0-4, this would return the response </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;START_RESPONSE BOARD_ID 4 0 0 1 45 2 90 3 135 4 180 END_RESPONSE WAIT_RESPONSE</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;CANCEL_SIGNAL 0 0 0 45 0 90 0 135 0 180</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> If this stream of bytes were sent instantly, it would essentially move servo 0 directly to 180 degrees (if it was a positional servo) because of the speed of the commands. However, if we inserted a slight delay, we could slowly move the servo from its starting position to its ending position. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;CANCEL_SIGNAL 0 0 1 0 0 45 1 45 0 90 1 90 0 135 1 135 0 180 1 180</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This would move servo 0 and servo 1 from their start to end positions. If we were to send these bytes immediately, they would essentially both move instantaneously to 180 degrees (if they were positional servos). However, if we were to insert a delay, they would both appear to move together slowly to their end location despite the delay between commands. Putting this functionality on the Arduino boards themselves would cause the boards to lock and use up resources, but formulating commands like this allows computation to occur on other systems.</p>
