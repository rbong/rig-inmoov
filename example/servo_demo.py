"""! Documentation for the servo_demo.py script.
An example script for controlling the right hand.
This script requires python with a library called pyserial.
After instally python 3.4, pyserial can be installed by calling

@code{.sh}
pip install pyserial
@endcode

This may vary from system to system.
See the <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> and
<a href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/">pyserial</a> websites for help.

To run the script, execute

@code{.sh}
python -i servo_demo.py
@endcode

or in python

@code{.py}
import servo_demo
@endcode

This will allow you to call the functions from a command interpreter.
It is recommended you experiment with all functions and view the source to
understand how you might produce commands. Also try demo() while connected.

The movements included are quickly written and for demo purposes only.

@see servo.ino Values

@var ser
The serial connection for input and output. Must be initialized.

@var RHAND_ID

    The output returned from the function is formatted in such a way that the
    commands can be transmitted to the serial port at variable speeds.

    The parameters must all be lists of the same length whose indexes
    correspond with \b servos.

    @param initial  An array of initial commands to append to.
    @param servos   The servos to control.
    @param starts   The current positions of the servos.
    @param ends     The desired end positions.
    @param steps    The values to use to decrement/increment.
                    Converted to absolute value.

    @returns Upon success, returns the generated list of commands.
    The commands are surrounded by the @ref CANCEL_SIGNAL for syncing.
    The servos will always reach their exact final destination, unless if
    \b steps at the index of the servo is 0.
    Upon error, raises <b>'Invalid sweep command'</b>.
    This indicates non-matching list lengths.

    @par Example
    @code sweep ([], [1,2], [180,0], [90,180], [90,45]) @endcode
    Returns

    The protocol this follows is described in servo.ino.
    By intertwining commands in this way, a delay can be inserted between
    bytes and fluid motion is still preserved.
